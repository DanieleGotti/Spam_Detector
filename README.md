# 📧 Spam Email Classification with MLP  
### *Deep Learning Assignment 1 - 2025*

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **spam email detector** using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network.  
Given a dataset of emails represented by numerical features, the model learns to classify each email as **spam** or **not-spam**.

## 📁 Dataset  
The dataset consists of:
- **Training set** with 57 input features and a binary target label  
- **Test set** with the same 57 features but without labels  

Class distribution in the training data:
- Not-spam (0): 2230 samples  
- Spam (1): 1450 samples  

## 🚀 Project Goals  
- Implement a fully connected neural network for binary classification  
- Experiment with different architectures and training configurations  
- Apply validation techniques to select the best model  
- Generate predictions on an unseen test set

## 🐍 Code Structure  
The project is implemented using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.
